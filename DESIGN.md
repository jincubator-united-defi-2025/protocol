# Design Unite Defi 2025 Jincubator

## Overview

The protocol implements extensions to the 1inch limit-order-protocol. To enable ERC-6909 support, resource locking and enhanced price discovery. It also facilitates back running of swaps as part of Interaction Order Extensions.

Stretch Goals include enhance price discovery and NEAR Fusion+ integration.

## Design

For Unite Defi we are working on 3 separate but compatible streams.

### Limit Order Protocol

Here are the Key Features Under Consideration

- Price Discovery: Integrating Pyth Oracles such as Redstone to improve Price Discovery
- Stop Loss Orders: Implementing a Holistic Advanced Limit Order (HALO) using a Predicate which passes price criteria for execution
- ERC-6909 Support: We implement the ability to Lock Resources in an ERC-6909 compatible Extension
- No Liquidity Solving (Same Chain Only): Provide the ability for Resolvers to use the Locked Resources as part of the Solve
- Portfolio Management: We implement the ability to rebalance the maker or takers assets during the fill with an Interaction

### Near Fusion+

We Integrate Near and 1inch Fusion (see [near-fusion-plus](https://github.com/jincubator-united-defi-2025/near-fusion-plus))

- Near Contracts for hash lock and time lock functionality
- Swap Functionality between Ethereum and Near via Fusion Plus
- Demonstration of bidirectional token transfers between Ethereum and NEAR

### Near Solver Built with NEAR's Shade Agent Framework

A decentralized solver which works with 1inch Fusion+

1. **Smart Contracts**

   - `solver-registry`: Support liquidity pools creation. Manage registration and verification of TEE solvers for each liquidity pool.
   - `intents-vault`: The vault contract that manage the pool's asset within NEAR Intents.

2. **Solver Management Server**
   - A Rust based server that manages the lifecycle of TEE solvers
   - Handles solver deployment and monitoring for each liquidity pool

### Design Questions

- Custom Limit Orders should not be posted to official Limit Order API. [Answered](https://discord.com/channels/554623348622098432/1385673870941618348/1399699600515796992)
  - Scripting is fine for the Hackathon
  - We don't need to build out our own API

## Implementation Details

### Limit Order Protocol Improvements

- Stop Loss and Take profit
  - Both basic and trailing SL/TP orders
  - [ChainLink Example](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/test/ChainLinkExample.js)
  - [Order Creation Logic to Populate Order Extension Information](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/description.md#order-extensions)
  - [Order Extensions](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/description.md) : [Extensions Code](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/tree/master/contracts/extensions)
    - ERC-6909 extension similar to [ERC1155PROXY.sol](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/contracts/extensions/ERC1155Proxy.sol)
      - Resource Locking Functionality integrating with [the-compact](https://github.com/uniswap/the-compact)
    - Price Discovery
      - [ChainCalculator.sol](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/contracts/extensions/chainLinkCalculator.sol): Reference Implementation see Price Discovery codebases below.
    - [Interactions](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/description.md#interactions): Interactions are callbacks that enable the execution of arbitrary code, which is provided by the maker’s order or taker’s fill execution.
      - ERC-6909 Settlement (including EIP-712 Signature Verification)
      - BackRunning Of Order

Note: For demonstration purposes we can use order and fulfillment via local scripts. It is recommended to use [Tenderly Virtual Testnets](https://tenderly.co/virtual-testnets) so that judges have visibility. (This is preferred over anvil).

### Price Discovery Improvements

- Tycho Indexing: For Streaming of State Changes of DeFi Protocols
- Tycho Simulation: For Price Discovery
- Pyth Oracle Integration: For Price Discovery

### Fusion+ to Near Implementations (Stretch Goal)

- Relayer
- [Resolver](https://github.com/1inch/cross-chain-resolver-example/blob/master/contracts/src/Resolver.sol)
  - [Fusion Resolver Example](https://github.com/1inch/fusion-resolver-example/blob/main/contracts/ResolverExample.sol) - don't need this one

### Near Solver Built with NEAR's Shade Agent Framework

### Components

- [Jincubator Near Fusion+](https://github.com/jincubator-united-defi-2025/near-fusion-plus): NEAR Fusion+ Smart contracts

### Foundational (git modules)

- [limit-order-protocol](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol): 1inch Limit Order Protocol Smart Contract. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency
- [https://github.com/1inch/cross-chain-swap](https://github.com/1inch/cross-chain-swap): 1inch Network Fusion Atomic Swaps
- [the-compact](https://github.com/uniswap/the-compact) : The Compact 🤝 ERC-6909 Resource Locking Mechanism an ownerless ERC6909 contract that facilitates the voluntary formation (and, if necessary, eventual dissolution) of reusable resource locks.
- [Tycho Execution](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-execution): Tycho Execution makes it easy to trade on different DEXs by handling the complex encoding for you. Instead of creating custom code for each DEX, you get a simple, ready-to-use tool that generates the necessary data to execute trades. It's designed to be safe, straightforward, and quick to set up, so anyone can start trading without extra effort.

## References

### Compatability

LimitOrderProtocol requires solidity 0.8.23 and tycho-execution having to be greater than 0.8.26.

We introduce a shim for LimitOrderProtocol in test/helpers

- DeployerHelper.sol: helper function for deploys using create2
- LimitOrderProtocolManager.sol: deploys the original(0.8.23) LimitOrderProtocol using bytecode
- ILimitOrderProtocol.sol: an interface for LimitOrderProtocol compatible with solidity ^0.8.23
- Deployers.sol: uses ILimitOrderProtocol with the LimitOrderProtocol deployed by LimitOrderProtocolManager
- AggrgratorMock.sol: we copy a version of this to `src\mocks\1inch` and make compatible with solidity ^0.8.23

### Prize Streams

#### 🍾 Expand Limit Order Protocol ⸺ $65,000 ($10,000 x 3, $7,000 x 3, $3500 x 4 )

1inch Limit Order Protocol is an onchain orderbook that can be extended to do much more. Build advanced strategies and hooks for the 1inch Limit Order Protocol like options, concentrated liquidity, TWAP swaps, etc.

Qualification Requirements:

- Onchain execution of strategy should be presented during the final demo
- Custom Limit Orders should not be posted to official Limit Order API
- Consistent commit history should be in the GitHub project. No low or single-commit entries allowed!

Stretch goals (not hard requirements):

- UI

#### 🌐 Extend Fusion+ to Near ⸺ $32,000 ($12,000, $7,500, $5,000, 4,000, $3500)

Build a novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) that enables swaps between Ethereum and Near.

Qualification Requirements:

- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
- Onchain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo

Stretch goals (not hard requirements):

- UI
- Enable partial fills
- Relayer and resolver

#### 🔗 Best 1inch Fusion+ Solver Built with NEAR's Shade Agent Framework ⸺ $10,000 (2x $5000)

Build a decentralized solver that integrates with 1inch Fusion+ for cross-chain swaps using NEAR's Shade Agent Framework and Trusted Execution Environment.

There is an existing decentralized NEAR Intents solver here:

- Solver manager and deployer https://github.com/Near-One/tee-solver/
- Solver https://github.com/think-in-universe/near-intents-tee-amm-solver/tree/feat/tee-solver

It listens for intents, generates quotes, and submits them for execution on NEAR Intents. Your task is to build a similar system that works with 1inch Fusion+ and its meta-order format. Make sure the solver is created using NEAR’s Shade Agent Framework and is deployed in a Trusted Execution Environment.

The Shade Agent Framework allows you to build decentralized solvers, enabling users to delegate and provide liquidity to solvers without requiring trust that the solver will behave correctly or having to set up their own solver.

Qualification Requirements:

Your solver must listen for quote requests (mocked or real), produce valid 1inch Fusion meta-orders using NEAR's Chain Signatures, include comprehensive documentation with setup instructions, and demonstrate end-to-end functionality. Bonus points for modular architecture that extends to other protocols.
