# Design Unite Defi 2025 Jincubator

## Overview

The protocol implements extensions to the 1inch limit-order-protocol. To enable ERC-6909 support, resource locking and enhanced price discovery. It also facilitates back running of swaps as part of Interaction Order Extensions.

Stretch Goals include enhance price discovery and NEAR Fusion+ integration.

## Design Questions

- Passing of [Extension Information](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/description.md#extensions-structure) when [building an order](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/description.md#how-to-build-an-order)
- Custom Limit Orders should not be posted to official Limit Order API. Does this mean just use scripting or should we build out our own API
- Relayer - contract or service
- Resolver - contract or service

### Limit Order Protocol Improvements

- Stop Loss and Take profit
  - Both basic and trailing SL/TP orders
  - [ChainLink Example](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/test/ChainLinkExample.js)
  - [Order Creation Logic to Populate Order Extension Information](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/description.md#order-extensions)
  - [Order Extensions](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/description.md) : [Extensions Code](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/tree/master/contracts/extensions)
    - []
    - ERC-6909 extension similar to [ERC1155PROXY.sol](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/contracts/extensions/ERC1155Proxy.sol)
      - Resource Locking Functionality integrating with [the-compact](https://github.com/uniswap/the-compact)
    - Price Discovery
      - [ChainCalculator.sol](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/contracts/extensions/ChainlinkCalculator.sol): Reference Implementation see Price Discovery codebases below.
    - [Interactions](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/master/description.md#interactions): Interactions are callbacks that enable the execution of arbitrary code, which is provided by the maker‚Äôs order or taker‚Äôs fill execution.
      - ERC-6909 Settlement (including EIP-712 Signature Verification)
      - BackRunning Of Order

### Price Discovery Improvements

- Tycho Indexing: For Streaming of State Changes of DeFi Protocols
- Tycho Simulation: For Price Discovery
- Pyth Oracle Integration: For Price Discovery

### Fusion+ to Near Implementations (Stretch Goal)

- Relayer
- Resolver

## Components

-

### Foundational (git modules)

- [limit-order-protocol](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol): 1inch Limit Order Protocol Smart Contract. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency
- [https://github.com/1inch/cross-chain-swap](https://github.com/1inch/cross-chain-swap): 1inch Network Fusion Atomic Swaps
- [the-compact](https://github.com/uniswap/the-compact) : The Compact ü§ù ERC-6909 Resource Locking Mechanism an ownerless ERC6909 contract that facilitates the voluntary formation (and, if necessary, eventual dissolution) of reusable resource locks.
- [Tycho Execution](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-execution): Tycho Execution makes it easy to trade on different DEXs by handling the complex encoding for you. Instead of creating custom code for each DEX, you get a simple, ready-to-use tool that generates the necessary data to execute trades. It's designed to be safe, straightforward, and quick to set up, so anyone can start trading without extra effort.

Build a novel extension for 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) that enables swaps between Ethereum and Near.

Qualification Requirements:

- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
- Onchain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo

Stretch goals (not hard requirements):

- UI
